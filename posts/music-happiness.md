Music has carried me through my best and worst moments in life. When I was dancing my heart out on the beach at my wedding, it was the beat of EDM. 

When I was sitting on a rooftop in Bankok wondering if I could ever live without my first girlfriend, I was listening to Townes Van Zandt.

My point is that it doesn't matter what mood you are in, there is always a song to match. And by choosing that song, you can also choose whether to go deeper in that mood or change it. 

It's amazing how much the choice in music can change your mood and outlook on live. When I am feeling down, I often feel like listening to songs with a certain melancholy to it. And that does exactly what you would think it does; make me feel more melancholic. 

If I want to pull myself out however, I better choose something upbeat. Not too upbeat, because than it will just annoy me. But, with a slightly upbeat song, I usually start to feel more positive. 

So, the next time you feel down, try it! Try deliberately choosing music for how you want to feel, instead of just picking what you feel like. I think you will be pleasantly surprised with the results. 

Take care!!!
